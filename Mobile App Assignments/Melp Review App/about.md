Get Movie Help with Melp

Itay = Design 

Evan = Browse Tab

Arusha = API & Movie Detail

Eylul = Reviews Tab

For everyone ages 13 and over looking for a an app where they can write reviews, search for movies, and share their ideas, Melp is the app for you! 

Live demonstration of the app in class. 

We used the Imdb API to search for movies, and the Firebase database for our reviews including movie name and image, getting the search bar and the API to work for the search bar was challenging. 

Technology highlights: Once you are logged in, in the reviews tab in the you can swipe any review in the list to the left to delete it. The reviews for specific movies also appear below each movie in the movies tab when you click on a movie. There is also a search feature where you can search for any movie in the movies tab.
