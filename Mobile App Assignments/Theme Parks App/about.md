This app's purpose is to give the user a list of the best theme parks in California. It gives a little picture, where it is on the map, 
and a description of the theme park. It comes with a filter to show you the few water parks in the big list of theme parks. It also allows you to 
favorite/like any park you're planning to go to or if it will help you remember which ones you loved visiting!
