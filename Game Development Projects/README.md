Game Development Projects:

1) Zombie Dice: Worked with a team of 3 and implemented the Player class that was responsible for picking and rolling the dice then ending that player's turn.

2) Haunted Mansion Puzzle Platformer: Individual project. Followed an initial platformer tutorial using Bolt and then changed multiple aspects of it to make it into a Puzzle Platformer. Implemented a Menu Screen, a pause screen, and 1 Level. (If the links don't work, file available upon request)
