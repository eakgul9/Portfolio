Game Development Projects:

1) Zombie Dice: Worked with a team of 3 and implemented the Player class that was responsible for picking and rolling the dice then ending that player's turn.

2) Haunted Mansion Puzzle Platformer: Individual project. Followed an initial platformer tutorial using Bolt and then changed multiple aspects of it to make it into a Puzzle Platformer. Implemented a Menu Screen, a pause screen, and 1 Level. (If the links don't work, file available upon request)

3) Minecraft in Unity: Individual project. Followed an old tutorial on YouTube. Had to update certain things to work with the newer version of Unity. Learned about complex concepts like Multi-threading, and Saving Systems. In the end, ran into some errors related to the custom saving system and wasn't able to fix those.

4) Escape Keck: Senior Project. Public GitHub repository link: https://github.com/eakgul9/EscapeKeck
