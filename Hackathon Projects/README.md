Hackathon Projects (made in 10 hours):

1. Recoup Web App: Worked as part of a team of 4. Recoup is the web App for all your recycling needs! Made with React, Firebase, and ChatGPT API. You can search up how to recycle certain items and it will give you a step-by-step process. We planned to use the MapBox GL API as well to show the nearest recycling centers but didn't have enough time as this was made during a Hackathon. GitHub link: https://github.com/Relectrik/RecoupApp

2. Tavern Trivia Web App: Worked as part of a team of 4. Trivia game inspired by a tavern theme. Made with React, Firebase Firestore, and Express. I wrote the questions for 3/4 categories on an excel sheet and exported it as a .csv file. Then I made a Firestore database and uploaded the questions into different collections based on their categories. This was used by the server to retrieve the questions and display them on the front end. GitHub link: https://github.com/zleodai/TriviaTavernGame
