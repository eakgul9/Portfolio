# Coding Portfolio
by Eylül Akgül

This repository includes my Projects and a variety of assignments I have completed in my Computer Science classes at LMU. Since the assignment repositories are private, I have compiled them here. Each folder has a README file that explains what each assignment consisted of and the number of people I worked with.
