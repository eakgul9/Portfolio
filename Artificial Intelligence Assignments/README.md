Artificial Intelligence Assignments:

All of these assignments were done in a group of two.

1) Propositional Logic: In maze_clause.py we wrote the constructor, the is_resolvable helper method, and the resolve method. In maze_knowledge_base.py we wrote the ask method. In maze_agent.py we wrote the constructor, the think method, is_safe_tile and the following helper methods: _inform_knowledge_base, _add_adjacent_tiles, _get_manhattan_distance, _return_min, and _get_closest_location.
