Algorithms Assignments:

All of these assignments were done individually, I was given the source file and was asked to write the algorithms. 

1) A* Algorithm: In Pathfinder.java, implemented the functions solve, getHeuristic, getPastCost, getTotalCost, getPath, and the Comparable SearchTreeNode class, including compareTo, hashCode and equals overrides. 

2) Edit Distance Algorithm: In DistlePlayer.java, implemented the functions makeGuess, and getFeedback. In EditDistanceUtils.java implemented the getEditDistTable, getTransformationList, editDistance, fillGutters and getTransformations.

3) Huffman Trie Algorithm: In Huffman.java implemented the Huffman, frequencyMapMaker, priorityQueueMaker, huffmanTrieMaker, encodingMapMaker, compress, bitStringMaker, decompress, and decoder. 

4) Minimax Algorithm: In T3Player.java implemented the functions choose, alphabeta, and utilityScore. In T3State.java implemented getTransitions.
